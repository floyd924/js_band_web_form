# js_band_web_form
band database web app // Javascript week 1 weekend assignment

     Welcome to the band database! This is a simple web application that allows the user to input various bands and relevant information, along with a photo.
      I've tried to experiment with google fonts, different input types with responses, and a link to a photo (local filepaths and url links accepted)


      I'd say my crowning jewl in this project has been the functionality to take an image url as a string input and return the image, complete with a border :)

    
      Lastly, for once I feel like my CSS looks good and is doing what I want it to do!

      There is no database involved in this project. No data is stored, only html is modified. All modifications are lost when the page is reloaded.
